## Student Information
Name: YOUR_NAME_HERE
Date: DATE_HERE

## Assignment Overview
This assignment focuses on working with Python data structures (lists and dictionaries), writing functions, using imports, and exploring basic recursion.

## Learning Objectives
- Master list operations and comprehensions
- Work with dictionaries and nested data structures
- Write functions that process collections
- Use Python modules (json, random, etc.)
- Understand basic recursion concepts

## Files in This Repository
- `problem1.py` - List operations and comprehensions
- `problem2.py` - Dictionary operations and nested structures
- `problem3.py` - Contact manager with functions
- `problem4.py` - Data persistence with JSON
- `bonus_recursion.py` - (Optional) Recursive problems

## How to Complete This Assignment

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd week4-lists-dicts-functions
   ```

2. **Complete each problem in its respective file**
   - Read the docstrings carefully
   - Follow the TODO comments
   - Test each function as you write it

3. **Test your solutions**
   ```bash
   python problem1.py
   python problem2.py
   python problem3.py
   python problem4.py
   python bonus_recursion.py  # if completed
   ```

4. **Run automated tests** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   pytest test_assignment.py -v
   ```

5. **Commit and push your work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Problem Set 4"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Submission Checklist
- [ ] Problem 1: All list functions work correctly
- [ ] Problem 2: Dictionary operations handle edge cases
- [ ] Problem 3: Contact manager has all features
- [ ] Problem 4: JSON saving/loading works
- [ ] (Optional) Bonus recursion problems completed
- [ ] All code is tested and working
- [ ] Code uses clear variable names and is well-commented
- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub

## Tips for Success
- **Start early** - Give yourself time to debug
- **Test incrementally** - Don't write all code at once
- **Use print statements** - Debug by printing intermediate values
- **Read error messages** - They tell you what went wrong
- **Ask for help** - Use Discord or office hours if stuck

## Assessment
This is a practice assignment designed to build your programming skills. Focus on understanding concepts rather than just getting tests to pass.

## Academic Integrity
You may:
- Use Python documentation
- Discuss concepts with classmates
- Ask questions on Discord

You may NOT:
- Copy code from other students
- Use AI to generate complete solutions
- Submit work that is not your own

Good luck! Remember: struggling with problems is part of learning to code.
